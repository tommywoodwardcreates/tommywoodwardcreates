### Hello there!

I’m a Perth-based graphic design and digital design graduate from Curtin University with additional skills in 3D design and photography. Since November 2019 I’ve been working in-house at Artforms Australia, a company that makes public art for local Perth councils. I also do freelance work in my spare time, so feel free to get in touch if you have a project in mind.

I have experience with 3ds Max, Adobe Creative Cloud (After Effects, Animate, Illustrator, InDesign, Lightroom, Photoshop, Premiere Pro and XD), Blender, Bootstrap, Confluence, CSS, Figma, FileZilla, Final Cut Pro, Git, HTML5, Ionic, JavaScript, Microsoft Office, PHP, MongoDB, Node.js, Postman, React, Sass, Trello, Twine and WordPress.
